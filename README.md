# ðŸ§¬ ScooterGenetics

**ScooterGenetics** is a lightweight Python library for comparing DNA sequences and building phylogenetic trees, tailored for genetic exploration and evolutionary visualization. Inspired by vermin studies (and scooters), this tool provides simple, readable outputs and educational visualizations for students and researchers alike.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Compare DNA Sequences**
  - Align FASTA files using global or local alignment.
  - Get sequence alignment score, percent relatedness, and species/genus/family relationship inference.

- ðŸŒ³ **Build Phylogenetic Trees**
  - Merge multiple FASTA files.
  - Use ClustalW to create sequence alignments.
  - Generate and render Newick-format phylogenetic trees.

- ðŸ–¼ **Export Tree as Image + HTML**
  - Render circular or rectangular trees using [`ete3`](http://etetoolkit.org/).
  - Output a static `.png` plus a clickable `.html` preview.

## ðŸ§ª Example Usage

```python
from ScooterGenetics import CompareSequences, BuildPhylogeneticTree, export_tree_ete

# Compare two sequences
CompareSequences("samples/A.fasta", "samples/B.fasta")

# Build tree from multiple FASTA files
tree = BuildPhylogeneticTree([
    "blattella/germanica/vermin_1.fasta",
    "parcoblatta/uhleriana/vermin_1.fasta",
    "parcoblatta/notha/vermin_1.fasta"
])

# Export visualized tree to HTML
export_tree_ete("tree.dnd", "phylo_tree.html")
```

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.8
- [Biopython](https://biopython.org/)
- [ete3](http://etetoolkit.org/)
- ClustalW2 (CLI tool must be in your system PATH)

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install biopython ete3
```
